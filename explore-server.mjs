// explore-server.mjs — the Explore tab's host. Dependency-free (node:http,
// node:fs, worker_threads), local-only: it binds localhost, serves this
// directory's static pages with no-store (serve.mjs's own reasoning — a

//
// THE RECORD (FOLD-CONSTITUTION I.5). Every computed event — a source
// opened, a read job with its declared parameters, a kinds job with its
// null arm, a deposit from Converse, an error — is appended to
// record/explore-record.jsonl before the response ships. Append-only: this
// file never truncates or rewrites it. The record is itself a file inside
// the browse root, so Explore can open its own record.
//
// WHAT THIS SERVER NEVER DOES: write inside the browse root except the
// places it owns (append-only record/ and materials/; the clearable web/
// store; library/, "My files" — its OWN ledger append-only, its files
// unlisted on remove and never byte-deleted); accept absolute paths; follow
// a path outside the root; call a model. Remote fetching exists ONLY inside
// the /api/web/* organ — the one
// sanctioned egress (POLICIES P13, amending P1): the page or search the
// user explicitly asked for, plus web.archive.org when the archive setting
// is on. Every crossing is recorded before or as it resolves; nothing is
// fetched that a request did not name; the BROWSER page still fetches
// nothing remote (web.test.mjs pins that seam).
